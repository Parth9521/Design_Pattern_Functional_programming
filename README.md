This is a group exercise
Form groups of 4 engineers each
For the assignment that you have done earlier for SOLID principles, see how you can change it with the functional programming constructs that you have learned
Write a blog about your experiences with functional programming


SOLID Principles With Functional Programming

SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin. These principles establish practices that lend to developing software with considerations for maintaining and extending as the project grows. Adopting these practices can also contribute to avoiding code smells, refactoring code, and Agile or Adaptive software development.
SOLID Principles:-

The following five concepts make up our SOLID principles:
    1. Single Responsibility
    2. Open/Closed
    3. Liskov Substitution
    4. Interface Segregation
    5. Dependency Inversion
These five software development principles are guidelines to follow when building software so that it is easier to scale and maintain. They were made popular by a software engineer, Robert C. Martin.

BENEFITS OF SOLID PRINCIPLES-

Some of the benefits SOLID Principle holds are as follows:-
    • Loose Coupling
    • Code Maintainability
    • Dependency Management
